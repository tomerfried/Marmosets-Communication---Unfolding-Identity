# Marmosets-Communication---Unfolding-Identity



The ability to replicate and modify sounds by non-human primates was considered almost nonexistent. Recent studies challenge the consensus of vocal learning abilities among non-human primates. To test these new revelations, with regards to the use of identity in communication, we delved into the communication of the Common Marmoset. We took calls of individual marmoset monkeys which were recorded between pairs of individuals and believed to contain factors related to identity. We wanted to check the existence of calls which are directed to specific individuals, like the way humans call themselves by names. This hypothesis is split into: Global directed calls â€“ a common call, used by multiple individuals and directed to a specific one. Local directed calls - a call used by a single individual and directed to a specific monkey. Using tools and methods from supervised learning, we discovered significant evidence which implies the existence of local calls, while for global calls we could not find significant evidence.

In this repo, the notebooks of our research can be found. Our results and conclusions are based on this work, which is described in further details in the article.
